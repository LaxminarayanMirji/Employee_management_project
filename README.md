**Employee Management System Description**

The Employee Management System is a web application built using the Python Django framework, with HTML for the frontend. It is designed to help organizations manage employee information efficiently, allowing users to add, edit, delete, and sort employee records. This system provides a simple and user-friendly interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data.

**Key Features:**
- **Add Employee:** Users can add new employees by entering essential details such as name, position, department, and contact information.
- **Edit Employee Details:** Users can update existing employee information, ensuring the data stays accurate and up to date.
- **Delete Employee:** Employees can be removed from the system when no longer required.
- **Sort Employee List:** Users can sort the employee list based on different attributes (e.g., name, position, department) for better organization and easy retrieval of employee information.

**How It Works:**
1. **Add Employee:** The user enters details such as the employee's name, job title, and department. This information is saved in the database.
2. **Edit Employee Details:** Users can click on an employee's record to update any incorrect or outdated information.
3. **Delete Employee:** When an employee leaves the organization or needs to be removed, the user can delete their record from the system.
4. **Sort Employee List:** The employee list can be sorted by specific fields like name, department, or job title to help users quickly find the information they need.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Backend:** Django (Python framework) to handle the application logic, form handling, and database operations.
- **Frontend:** HTML for creating the structure of the user interface, along with CSS for basic styling.
- **Database:** SQLite (default database in Django) to store employee records securely.

**Benefits:**
- Streamlined employee data management.
- Easy-to-use interface for adding, editing, and deleting employee records.
- Sorting functionality to help users quickly find and organize employee information.

This Employee Management System can be further expanded to include additional features like role-based access, search functionality, and employee performance tracking.
